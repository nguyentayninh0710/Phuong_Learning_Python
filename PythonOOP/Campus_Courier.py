'''
Project: Campus Courier — On-Campus Delivery Robot Scheduler
Context

Your university runs an internal delivery service. The fleet contains multiple delivery units: ground rovers and drones. Each unit has capacity, speed, and battery (energy) constraints; energy consumption differs by unit type. Each job has an ID, distance, payload weight, and a deadline (in minutes from “now”).
Your task is to design, implement, and test a scheduling module that assigns robots to maximize on-time deliveries.

Learning Objectives

Encapsulation: manage state with @property, enforce invariants, show Python “private” via name-mangling.

Abstraction: define behavioral contracts using abc.ABC and @abstractmethod.

Inheritance: derive specialized subclasses from an abstract base.

Polymorphism: override methods like energy_cost(...), __str__, and use a common API across unit types.

Core algorithms: implement selection sort (deadlines), linear/binary search, FIFO queue simulation (optional small recursion).

Traditional engineering discipline: type hints, docstrings, unit tests, clean CLI I/O.

Functional Requirements

1) Data Model

Job with fields: job_id: str, distance_m: int, weight_kg: float, deadline_min: int.

Natural ordering by deadline_min then job_id.

DeliveryUnit (ABC):

Base attributes: unit_id: str, capacity_kg: float, speed_mps: float, __battery_wh: float (encapsulated).

Properties:

battery_wh is read-only externally (charge through a method).

capacity_kg, speed_mps must be > 0 (raise ValueError otherwise).

Abstract methods:

energy_cost(distance_m: int, load_kg: float) -> float

can_carry(load_kg: float) -> bool

Concrete helpers:

estimate_time(distance_m: int) -> float (seconds)

dispatch(job: Job) -> float (decrease battery by energy cost; raise on insufficient battery/overload)

charge(amount_wh: float) -> None

Subclasses Drone(DeliveryUnit) & Rover(DeliveryUnit):

Polymorphism: different energy models, e.g. drones are highly load-sensitive; rovers scale more linearly.

2) Scheduler

selection_sort_by_deadline(jobs: list[Job]) -> None (in-place).

linear_search(jobs, job_id) -> int returns index or -1.

binary_search(jobs_sorted_by_id, job_id) -> int (assumes sorted by job_id).

assign(jobs, units) -> dict[str, str]

Process jobs in increasing deadline order.

For each job, choose a feasible unit (can_carry and enough battery) with the minimum ETA.

Return mapping {job_id: unit_id}.

run_queue(jobs, units) -> list[str]

Simulate execution using the assignment mapping; return log lines:
"J001 -> D-A | eta=80.0s | energy=35.2Wh | status=ONTIME"

3) I/O

Read jobs from jobs.csv (schema below).

Print a concise results table/log with job_id, unit_id, eta_s, energy_used, status.

Write the same to report.txt.

4) Unit Tests (at least 6)

Drone.energy_cost and Rover.energy_cost (positive, increases with distance).

can_carry logic.

selection_sort_by_deadline correctness.

binary_search hit/miss cases.

assign must reject overweight jobs or insufficient battery.

5) Constraints & Exceptions

Use ValueError/RuntimeError appropriately.

Do not use built-in sorts inside your selection sort (the point is to practice the algorithm).

Provide complete typing hints.
